## Mini Project 1: Federalist Papers

Since I have been listening to the Hamilton soundtrack most of this week, I decided the [Federalist Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers) would be a 
good test subject for some practice text mining that will go hand in hand with my thesis topic. Luckily, thanks to [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) (`{gutenbergr}`), we can download the text of these important documetns for free.

For this mini-project, my personal goals are:

- [x] Create simplistic, but effective, data visualizations
- [x] Use some _fancy_ `{ggplot2}` peripherals and features (images, annotations, etc)
- [x] Figure out some concepts related to my thesis work.

These dataset would also be useful for a text mining or ML course :wink:, since there is the potential to classify text by author or essay, to assess the topics of essays, to look at summary statistics for text, etc.
